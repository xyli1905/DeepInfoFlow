# Repo for CMPS218 Spring 19 project Deep Information flow
This repo is for UCSC CMPS218 Foundation of data science project.<br/>
Our code is composed mainly by two parts IBNet.py and ComputeMI.py.<br/>
IBNet.py is responsible for training and plotting mean_std plot and SVD plots.<br/>
ComputeMI.py is responsible for estimating mutual information(MI).<br/>
Our training data is coming from [ibsgd](https://github.com/artemyk/ibsgd) project. And we also reproduce the results from there project. This project is still on going, detailed description comes later.
